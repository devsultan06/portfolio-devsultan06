            <p className="mb-[10px]"><span className="mr-[40px]">3</span>   <span></span>* I'm Sultan  a front-end developer who enjoys crafting clean, responsive user interfaces with attention to both aesthetics and structure.</p>
            <p className="mb-[10px]"><span className="mr-[40px]">4</span>   * I'm popularly known as DevSultan in the tech space.</p>
            <p className="mb-[10px]"><span className="mr-[40px]">5</span>   * I know how to use Figma tools quite well, but I sometimes feel I lack the creative edge for design, so I focus on bringing other people's creativity to life through code.</p>

            <p className="mb-[10px]"><span className="mr-[40px]">6</span>   * I prioritize modularizing my code for better scalability and readability.</p>
            <p className="mb-[10px]"><span className="mr-[40px]">7</span>   * Over time, that mindset has helped me build and iterate on more maintainable web apps.</p>
            <p className="mb-[10px]"><span className="mr-[40px]">8</span>   * I'm currently learning backend development (Node JS) to better understand full-stack workflows and to build complete, end-to-end products with confidence.</p>
            <p className="mb-[10px]"><span className="mr-[40px]">9</span>  * Lately, I’ve also started solving LeetCode and algorithm problems to sharpen my logic.</p>
            <p className="mb-[10px]"><span className="mr-[40px]">10</span>  * It’s been a rewarding challenge that’s made me more intentional about how I solve problems.</p>
            <p className="mb-[10px]"><span className="mr-[40px]">11</span>  * I’ve also recently developed an interest in content writing. It’s something I naturally enjoy, and I'm currently exploring ways to blend storytelling with my tech journey.</p>
            <p className="mb-[10px]"><span className="mr-[40px]">12</span>  * I'm also building something quietly in the background a startup called "Conova." It’s still undisclosed and under development for now, but it’s a project I'm excited about and pouring my energy into.</p>
